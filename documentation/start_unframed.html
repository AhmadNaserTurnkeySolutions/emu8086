Click <B>code examples</B> and select <B>Hello, world</B>. A code example with many comments should open. All comments are green and they take up about <B>90%</B> of all text, so don't be scared by this tiny <I>"Hello Word"</I> code. The compiled executable is only about <B>100</B> bytes long, because it uses no interrupts and has only one loop for color <I>highlighting</I> the text. All other code is straight-forward and writes directly to video memory.<BR><BR>

To run this example in the emulator, click <B>emulate</B> (or press <B>F5</B>). The program then attmepts to assemble and save the executable to <B>c:\emu8086\MyBuild</B>. If the assembler succeeds in creating the file, the emulator will also automatically load it into memory.<BR><BR>
</LI>

<LI>
You can then click <B>single step</B> (or press <B>F8</B>) to step through the code one instruction at a time, observing changes in registers and the emulator screen. You can also click <B>step back</B> (or press <B>F6</B>) to see what happens when reversing those changes.<BR><BR>
</LI>

<LI>
There are many ways to print <I>"Hello,World"</I> in assembly language, and this certainly isn't the shortest way. If you click <B>examples</B> and browse <B>c:\emu8086\examples</B>, you'll find <B>HelloWorld.asm</B> which assembles into only a <B>30</B>-byte executable. Unlike the previous example which carries out each step by itself, this one is much smaller because it uses a built-in interrupt function of the operating system to write to the display.<BR><BR>

The integrated 8086 assembler can generate console programs that can be executed on any computer that
runs x86 machine code (Intel/AMD architecture)

<BR><BR>

The architecture of the 8086 Intel microprocessor is called &quot;Von Neumann architecture&quot; after
the mathematician who conceived of the design.

<BR><BR>

NOTE: A CPU can interpret the contents of memory as either instructions or data; there's no difference 
in the individual bytes of memory, only the way in which they're arranged. Because of this, 
it's even possible for programs to re-write their own instructions, then execute the instructions they've changed.
