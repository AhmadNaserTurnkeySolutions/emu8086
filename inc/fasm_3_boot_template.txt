; BIOS reads 512 bytes from cylinder: 0, head: 0, sector: 1
; of bootable floppy drive, then it loads this data into
; memory at 0000:7c00h and starts the execution from the first byte.

; note: this file is assembled into .bin file.
;       default configuration for .binf file:
;       load segment: 0000, load offset: 7c00, 
;       same values are set to CS and IP registers accordingly.

; .binf file is used by the emulator to decide at what memory
; address to load binary file and start the execution, when 
; loading address is set to 0000:7c00 it emulates the way BIOS
; loads the boot record into the memory.

; the output of this format is identical to format created from
; bin template, both templates create plain binary files.
; .boot output type is outdated because of its redundancy.
; you can write .bin file to boot record of a real
; floppy drive using writebin.asm (it's required to assemble this file first)

; note: you may not use dos interrupts for boot record code,
;       unless you manually replace them in interrupt vector table.
;       (refer to global memory map in the documentation)
