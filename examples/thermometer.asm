; this short program for emu8086 shows how to keep constant temperature
; using heater and thermometer (between 60° to 80°),
; it is assumed that air temperature is lower 60°.

; thermometer.exe is started automatically from c:\emu8086\devices.
; it is also accessible from the "virtual devices" menu of the emulator.

#start=thermometer.exe#

; temperature rises fast, thus emulator should be set to run at the maximum speed.

; if closed, the thermometer window can be re-opened from emulator's "virtual devices" menu.
