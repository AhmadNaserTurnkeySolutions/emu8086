Description: Simple line printer device

** Usage **

Start up printer.exe. Now the printer can be accessed through port 130 (decimal).

Controlling it is simple, you just 'out' a byte to the printer port and it'll print out
the corresponding character onto the page, then clear the port back to zero once its
done, that way you can tell when it's time to pass it the next character.

A few things to note:

If the char value is greater than 31, then it'll just be printed straight out.
Below and including that, it's won't be printed (they wouldn't come out anyway?)
apart from the ones that I've implemented:

07 - Bell. Well I had to didn't I?  ;)
08 - Backspace, move print head left one character
10 - Line feed
13 - Carriage return

The below 32 control codes are actually ascii control codes.

Well, have a good play with it - the VB source is included too if you're interested.

** Notes/Todo **

- Please email me if you have any coments/requests, bug fixes.
- It's not finished yet, apart from the basic functionality.
- Not a lot distinguishes it from the user screen, I was trying to get a printer head moving across (see the .bmps)
  the screen but couldn't figure out why VB wasn't moving it. Also maybe it could be joined with a real printer?
  And it's interface could be closer to that of a real parallel port.
- Must sleeeeppp .....
